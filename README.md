### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<p>
Thanks for visiting my tiny corner of the internet! I'm Bailey. I graduated from NAU with a bachelor's degree in applied computer science in 2021, now working on jump starting my career.

</p>

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning

<p>
Everything! Brushing up on my `Git` and `Python`, tinkering with `Jekyll` and `Netlify` to get my personal website up and running, and working on deepening my knowledge of `SQL Server` and `Tableau`. I can't wait to share what I've learned with you!
